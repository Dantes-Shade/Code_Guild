# Problem 1
# Given a the two lists below, combine them into a dictionary.

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']
# price = [1.2, 3.3, 2.1]

# def combine(a, b):
#     my_dict = dict(zip(a, b))
#     return my_dict

# print(combine(fruits, price))

# Problem 2
#Using the result from the previous problem, iterate through the dictionary and calculate the average price of an item.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']
price = [1.2, 3.3, 2.1]

def combine(a, b):
    my_dict = dict(zip(a, b))
    return my_dict

def average(d):
    

combine(fruits, price) = expensive_fruits
